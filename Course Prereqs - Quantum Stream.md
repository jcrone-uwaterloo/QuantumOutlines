# Course Prereqs â€“ Quantum Stream
## Overview
After reviewing the course outlines for the Quantum stream courses (PHYS 122, PHYS 124, PHYS 234, PHYS 334, PHYS 434) from the last two years, we do not see any material that falls far outside of the current course prerequisites; at least any that is revealed from this preliminary overview.  

For each Quantum stream course, the listed course description for each prerequisite course is shown below. The relevant portions of each course are [highlighted with empty links](). It is our opinion, however, that there are very few parts of the below prerequisite courses that are not applicable to the related Quantum stream courses. Where there are multiple course options, the course from the Honours Physics stream is arbitrarily chosen to demonstrate the important material. 

## PHYS 122: Waves, Electricity and Magnetism
Currently Listed Prereq: 
- **Mechanics:** One of PHYS 111 (minimum grade 70%), 115, 121, ECE 105.
