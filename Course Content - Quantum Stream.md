This course will start with a review of the most important concepts from the two previous quantum mechanics courses. We will then cover continuous quantum variables (i.e. wave functions in position x and momentum p). We will study quantum time evolutions in different pictures (the Schrödinger picture, the Heisenberg picture, and the interaction picture), and apply these formalisms to different examples. In the next part, we will have an in-depth look at rotationsand quantum spin systems. We will also cover symmetries in quantum mechanics. In this context, we will for example see how the momentum operator p acts as generator for translations in space, and how angular momentum operators act as generators for rotations. These are examples of continuous symmetries. We will also study discrete symmetries such as the parity symmetry, which leads us to the concept of identical particles, the distinction between Fermions and Bosons, and the puzzling consequences of quantum statistics. If time allows, we will cover modern topics in our last week (quantum teleportation, quantum computing).
